  // Within this class, there is a private _unsubscribed property which is a flag to track whether the unsubscribe() method has been called on this observable. If unsubscribed() has been called, we should not make any further calls on the observer's methods (next, error, completed). To achieve this functionality, the createStoppableObserver() method will create a new observer object by wrapping all of the methods from the source observer with a function that respects the _unsubscribed flag. If the flag is false (i.e. unsubscribe() has not been called), then the method of the source observable is executed. If the flag is true, then we know unsubscribe() has already been called and we do not make any further calls on those observer methods.

  // Similar to the createStoppableObserver() method, we need to create a stoppable clean up function that can be indirectly executed from outside the observable object whenever unsubscribe() is called. We want the function to be stoppable because it has to respect the _unsubscribed flag within this observable class. If the flag is true, then the clean up function is not executed. If it's false, then we set the flag to true and then execute the clean up function. This way we effectively allow unsubscribe() to be called only once because any further calls of the method will have no effect.

    };
  }

  // When the subscribe() method is called, the Producer function is executed and the Observable will start generating values. Remember that calling the Producer function also returns the clean-up function. We hold a reference to that original unstoppable clean up method within this class for private/internal use. We also create a stoppable version of the clean up function by running it through the createStoppableCleanUpFn() method. The stoppable clean-up function is placed inside an object and assigned to the unsubscribe() method and returned. This way, unsubscribe() can be called externally to invoke the (stoppable) clean-up function.
  subscribe(observer: Observer<T>): Subscription {
    const stoppableObserver: Observer<T> =
      this.createStoppableObserver(observer);

  // pipe() accepts operators that can be used to transform or work with data emitted by the primary observable. In general, the pipe() method works by building a pipeline of function that subscribe to a source observable (either the first observable or the previous observable in the pipeline), using or transforming the data emitted by the source observable and returning a new observable that will pass the manipulated data down to the next observer in the pipeline.
